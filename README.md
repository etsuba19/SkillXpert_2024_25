**SkillXpert**

Our E-Learning Platform is a web-based application designed to facilitate online learning by providing features such as course management, user authentication, and role-based authorization. The platform will allow students and instructors to interact through a secure and modular system. It will feature a REST API built with NestJS for handling user and role management, as well as providing full CRUD operations for course management. The application will be built using Bootstrap for the front end, with JavaScriptâ€™s Fetch API for communicating with the back-end services.

**Key Features**

1. **JWT-based Authentication and Authorization**
   - Users will register and log in to the platform using JWT tokens for secure authentication.
   - Role management will be implemented to differentiate between student and instructor roles, with each role having different levels of access.

2. **Course Management (CRUD operations)**
   - Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses.
   - Students can view available courses and enroll in them.
   - Each course will contain details like name, description, instructor, and enrollment information.

3. **RESTful API**
   - The backend API will follow RESTful best practices for resource management.
   - The API will be modular, with separate modules for authentication/authorization and course management features.

4. **Frontend Development**
   - The frontend will be developed using Bootstrap for responsive design and TypeScript for writing robust JavaScript code.
   - Fetch API will be used for interacting with the backend to perform CRUD operations on courses.

5. **Database Selection**
   - A relational database  will be used for storing user, role, and course data. This choice is based on the need for structured relationships between users, roles, and courses.
